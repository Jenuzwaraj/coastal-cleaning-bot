# coastal-cleaning-bot
This project features an ESP32-CAM module that powers a coastal clean botâ€”a remote-controlled car equipped with live camera feed streaming to a smartphone. The bot can be remotely controlled while providing real-time video footage via the ESP32-CAM module, and includes additional features like stepper motor control, distance sensing, and buzzer alerts.
