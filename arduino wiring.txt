A4988 Driver to Arduino:
VDD pin of A4988 to 5V on Arduino
GND pin of A4988 to GND on Arduino
STEP pin of A4988 to a digital pin on Arduino (e.g., pin 3)
DIR pin of A4988 to a digital pin on Arduino (e.g., pin 4)
Enable pin (often labeled as /ENABLE) of A4988 to GND (to enable the motor driver)
Motor A+ and A- to the stepper motor's wires (for one coil)
Motor B+ and B- to the stepper motor's wires (for the other coil)
VMOT to an external power supply (e.g., 12V)
GND to the external power supply ground and also to Arduino GND

short sleep and reset of a4988

Power:
Make sure your external power supply provides enough current for the NEMA 17 stepper motor. The Arduino will power the A4988, but the stepper motor will need more power than the Arduino can supply.
